# Reports
Program meant to convert data submitted to our office in the given format of the input.txt file. The output file should be 
a .csv that will be used to import into an access database. Each role that a person has will be a new record in the database
with the full set of information of the user being reentered on each line, as it is currently doing.

Need to implement the following:

1. Properly eliminate the blank entry that is generated by the trailing comma on each line of the input file 
to replace the current work-around of just deleting the last record in the rolesList list before printing/writing. 
2. Enable command-line parameters
